Hi friends.
I'm MinTGaming/Akari Shimizu, the creator of Meowniverse Studio/Meownigames.
Currently, we have 2 projects running: THE enCOUNTER and War Machines.
We'll need some voluntary coders, modeling editors for our FOSS, community-driven games.
Feel free to DM me at mintgaming@outlook.com.vn to get access to the codebase.
